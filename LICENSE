I have witnessed those foul denizens of Tartarus beseeching gods and goddesses to be released of their chains. By their conniving wickedness and beguiling nature, do they find freedom through trickery, and escape to our Earthly plane.

One look at my code and they flee back to the cold, unforgiving depths in fear and disgust.
